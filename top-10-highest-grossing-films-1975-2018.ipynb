And more often than not, the ones scooping up all the awards don't end up as the highest grossing ones or *box-office hits*. \nThe highest grossing ones are those which audiences have watched the most at cinemas and hence, the gross.\n\nIn this project, the different correlations between the relevant information about each film, viz. the length of a film, the rating of a film and the distributing studio to name a few, are charted against other factors.\n\n*The main aim of this project is to find out whether or not we find any robust correlation between any two of these parameters.*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"afef8268f7e8ce9e9efb706d19e0b8ddf511c0da"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Exploratory Analysis**\n## A.

The individual categories include the stated age groups within the category, along with all ages greater than the ages of that category.\n\n[Motion Picture Association of America](https://www.mpaa.org/) categorizes Hollywood films mainly into 4 categories.\n- **G – General Audiences** : All ages admitted.

May contain some material parents might not like for their young children.\n- **PG-13 – Parents Strongly Cautioned** : Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. Parents are urged to be cautious. Some material may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers.\n- **R – Restricted** : Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Contains some adult material.
